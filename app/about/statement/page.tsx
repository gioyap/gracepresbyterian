								I. The Holy Scriptures
							</h2>

							<div className="space-y-4">
								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										1. Inspiration and Authority
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that the Bible is God’s written revelation to man,
										and thus the sixty-six books of the Bible given to us by the
										Holy Spirit constitute the plenary (inspired equally in all
										parts) Word of God (1 Corinthians 2:7-14; 2 Peter 1:20-21)
										that is an objective, propositional revelation (1
										Thessalonians 2:13) verbally inspired in every word (2
										Timothy 3:16), absolutely inerrant in the original
										documents, infallible and God-breathed, the only infallible
										rule of faith and practice (Matthew 5:18; 24:35; John 10:35;
										16:12-13; 17:17; 1 Corinthians 2:13; 2 Timothy 3:15-17;
										Hebrews 4:12; 2 Peter 1:20-21).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										2. Interpretation
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach the literal, grammatical, historical interpretation
										of Scripture, which affirms the belief that the opening
										chapters of Genesis present creation in six literal 24-hour
										days (Genesis 1:31; Exodus 31:17).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										3. Dual Authorship
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach God spoke in His written Word by a process of dual
										authorship. The Holy Spirit so superintended the human
										authors that, through their individual personalities and
										different styles of writing, as sunlight through stained
										glass windows, they composed and recorded God’s Word to man
										(2 Peter 1:20-21) without error in the whole or in the part
										(Matthew 5:18; 2 Timothy 3:16).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										4. True Interpretation
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that whereas there may be several applications of
										any given passage of Scripture, there is but one true
										interpretation. The meaning of Scripture is to be found as
										one diligently applies the literal grammatical-historical
										method of interpretation under the enlightenment of the Holy
										Spirit (John 7:17; 16:12-15; 1 Corinthians 2:7-15; 1 John
										2:20). It is the responsibility of believers as they grow in
										maturity, to ascertain carefully the true intent and meaning
										of Scripture, recognizing that such truth is binding on all
										generations. Yet the truth of Scripture stands in judgment
										of men; never do men stand in judgment of it.

							<p>
								We teach that there is but one living and true God (Deuteronomy
								6:4; Isaiah 45:5-7; 1 Corinthians 8:4), an infinite, all-knowing
								Spirit (John 4:24), perfect in all His attributes, one in
								essence, eternally existing in three Persons – Father, Son, and
								Holy Spirit (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14), each equally

							<div className="space-y-4">
								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										1. Sovereignty and Creation
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that God the Father, the first person of the
										Trinity, orders and disposes all things according to His own
										purpose and grace (Psalm 145:8,9; 1 Corinthians 8:6).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										2. Creator
									</h3>
									<p>
										He is the creator of all things (Genesis 1:1-31; Ephesians
										3:9).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										3. Absolute Ruler
									</h3>
									<p>
										He is the only absolute and omnipotent ruler in the
										universe; He is sovereign in creation, providence, and
										redemption (Psalm 103:19; Romans 11:36).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										4. Fatherhood
									</h3>
									<p>
										His fatherhood involves both His designation within the
										Trinity and His relationship with mankind as Creator. He is
										Father to all men (Ephesians 4:6), but He is spiritual
										Father only to believers (Romans 8:14; 2 Corinthians 6:18).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										5. Decree and Governance
									</h3>
									<p>
										He has decreed for His own glory all things that come to
										pass (Ephesians 1:11). He continually upholds, directs, and
										governs all creatures and events (1 Chronicles 29:11). He
										has graciously chosen from eternity past those whom He would
										have as His own (Ephesians 1:4-6). He saves from sin all who
										come to Him through Jesus Christ; He adopts as His own all
										those who come to Him; and He becomes, upon adoption, Father
										to His own (John 1:12; Romans 8:15; Galatians 4:5; Hebrews
										12:5-9).

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										1. Divine Excellencies
									</h3>
									<p>
										Jesus Christ, the second Person of the Trinity, possesses
										all the divine excellencies, and in these He is coequal,
										consubstantial, and coeternal with the Father (John 10:30;
										14:9).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										2. Creation through the Son
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that God the Father created all things according to
										His own will, through His Son, Jesus Christ, and in Him all
										things hold together (John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-17; Hebrews
										1:2).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										3. The Incarnation
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that in the incarnation (God becoming man) Christ
										surrendered only the prerogatives of deity but nothing of
										the divine essence, either in degree or kind. In His
										incarnation, Christ’s divine nature united with a human
										nature in an indissoluble union, and so He became the
										God-man (Philippians 2:5-8; Colossians 2:9).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										4. Unity of Humanity and Deity
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that Jesus Christ represents humanity and deity in
										indivisible oneness (Micah 5:2; John 14:9-10; Colossians
										2:9; John 5:23).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										5. Virgin Birth
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that our Lord Jesus Christ was virgin born (Isaiah
										7:14; Matthew 1:23, 25; Luke 1:26-35).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										6. Purpose of the Incarnation
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that He was God incarnate (John 1:1,14); and the
										purpose of the incarnation was to reveal God, redeem men,
										and rule over God’s kingdom (Psalm 2:7-9; Isaiah 9:6; John
										1:29; Philippians 2:9-11; Hebrews 7:25-26; 1 Peter 1:18-19).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										7. Humility and Service
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that in the incarnation, the second person of the
										Trinity laid aside His right to the full prerogatives of
										coexistence with God, assumed the place of a Son, and took
										on an existence appropriate to a servant while never
										divesting Himself of His divine attributes (Philippians
										2:5-8).

							<div className="space-y-4">
								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										1. Accomplished Redemption
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that our Lord Jesus Christ accomplished our
										redemption through His death on the cross and that His death
										was voluntary, vicarious, substitutionary, propitiatory, and
										redemptive (John 10:15; Romans 3:24-25; 5:8; 1 Peter 2:24).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										2. Results of Redemption
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that on the basis of the efficacy of the death of
										our Lord Jesus Christ, the believing sinner is freed from
										the punishment, the penalty, the power, and one day the very
										presence of sin; and that he is declared righteous, given
										eternal life, and adopted into the family of God (Romans
										3:25, 5:8-9; 2 Corinthians 5:14-15; 1 Peter 2:24; 3:18).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										3. Justification and Resurrection
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that our justification is made sure by His literal,
										physical resurrection from the dead and that He is now
										ascended to the right hand of the Father, where He now
										mediates as our Advocate and High Priest (Matthew 28:6; Luke
										24:38-39; Acts 2:30-31; Romans 4:25; 8:34; Hebrews 7:25;
										9:24; 1 John 2:1).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										4. Proof and Guarantee
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that in the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the
										grave, God confirmed the deity of His Son and gave proof
										that God has accepted the atoning work of Christ on the
										cross. And that Jesus’ bodily resurrection is also the
										guarantee of a future resurrection life for all believers
										(John 5:26-29; 14:19; Romans 1:4; 4:25; 6:5-10; 1
										Corinthians 15:20,23).

									<p>
										We teach that Jesus Christ will return to receive the

										returning with His church in glory, will establish His
										millennial kingdom on earth (Acts 1:9-11; 1 Thessalonians
										4:13-18; Revelation 20).

									<ul className="list-disc pl-5">
										<li>
											Believers (1 Corinthians 3:10-15; 2 Corinthians 5:10).

								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										3. Mediator and Final Judge
									</h3>
									<p>
										As the mediator between God and man (1 Timothy 2:5), the

										Colossians 1:18), and the coming universal King who will
										reign on the throne of David (Isaiah 9:6; Luke 1:31-33), He
										is the final judge of all who fail to place their trust in
										Him as Savior and Lord (Matthew 25:14-46; Acts 17:30-31).

							<div className="space-y-4">
								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										1. Divine Attributes
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that the Holy Spirit is a divine person, eternal,
										underived, possessing all the attributes of the Godhead:
									</p>
									<ul className="list-disc pl-5">
										<li>Intellect (1 Corinthians 2:10-13);</li>
										<li>Emotions (Ephesians 4:30);</li>

										<li>Omniscience (Isaiah 40:13-14);</li>
										<li>Omnipotence (Romans 15:13);</li>
										<li>Truthfulness (John 16:13).</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										We teach that in all the divine attributes He is coequal and
										consubstantial with the Father and the Son (Matthew 28:19;
										Acts 5:3-4; 28:25-26; 1 Corinthians 12:4-6; 2 Corinthians
										13:14; Jeremiah 31:31-34 with Hebrews 10:15-17).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										2. Work of the Holy Spirit
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that it is the work of the Holy Spirit to execute
										the divine will with relation to all mankind. We recognize
										His sovereign activity in creation (Genesis 1:2), the
										incarnation (Matthew 1:18), the written revelation (2 Peter
										1:20-21), and the work of salvation (John 3:5-7).
									</p>
									<p>
										We teach that the work of the Holy Spirit in this age began
										at Pentecost, when He came from the Father as promised by
										Christ (John 14:16-17; 15:26) to initiate and complete the
										building of the body of Christ, which is His church (1
										Corinthians 12:13). The broad scope of His divine activity
										includes convicting the world of sin, of righteousness, and
										of judgment; glorifying the Lord Jesus Christ and
										transforming believers into the image of Christ (John
										16:7-9; Acts 1:5; 2:4; Romans 8:29; 2 Corinthians 3:18;
										Ephesians 2:22).

									F. Holy Spirit and the Church
								</h2>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										1. Regeneration and Empowerment
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that the Holy Spirit is the supernatural and
										sovereign agent in regeneration, baptizing all believers
										into the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:13). The Holy
										Spirit also indwells, sanctifies, instructs, empowers them
										for service, and seals them unto the day of redemption
										(Romans 8:9; 2 Corinthians 3:6; Ephesians 1:13).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										2. Divine Teacher
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that the Holy Spirit is the divine teacher who
										guided the apostles and prophets into all truth as they
										committed to writing God’s revelation, the Bible. Every
										believer possesses the indwelling presence of the Holy
										Spirit from the moment of salvation, and it is the duty of
										all those born of the Spirit to be filled with (controlled
										by) the Spirit (John 16:13; Romans 8:9; Ephesians 5:18; 2
										Peter 1:19-21; 1 John 2:20,27).
									</p>
								</div>

								<div>
									<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
										3. Spiritual Gifts
									</h3>
									<p>
										We teach that the Holy Spirit alone administers spiritual
										gifts to the church. The Holy Spirit glorifies neither
										Himself nor His gifts by ostentatious displays, but all He
										does is to glorify Christ, to implement His work of
										redeeming the lost, and to build up believers in the most
										holy faith (John 16:13-14; Acts 1:8; 1 Corinthians 12:4-11;
										2 Corinthians 3:18).
									</p>
									<p>
										We teach, in this respect, that God the Holy Spirit is
										sovereign in the bestowing of all His gifts for the
										perfecting of the saints today and that speaking in tongues
										(unlearned foreign languages) and the working of sign
										miracles gradually stopped as the New Testament Scriptures
										were completed and their authority became established (1
										Corinthians 12:4-11; 13:8-10; 2 Corinthians 12:12; Ephesians
										4:7-12; Hebrews 2:1-4).

						III. Man
					</h2>

					<div className="space-y-4">
						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								1. Creation and Nature
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that man was directly and immediately created by God in
								His image and likeness. Man was created free of sin with a
								rational nature, intelligence, volition, self-determination, and
								moral responsibility to God (Genesis 2:7, 15-25; James 3:9).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								2. Purpose of Creation
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that God’s intention in the creation of man was that
								man should glorify God, enjoy God’s fellowship, live his life in
								the will of God and by this, accomplish God’s purpose for man in
								the world (Isaiah 43:7; Colossians 1:16; Revelation 4:11).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								3. The Fall and Its Consequences
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that in Adam’s sin of disobedience to the revealed will
								and Word of God, man lost his innocence, incurred the penalty of
								spiritual and physical death, became subject to the wrath of
								God, and became inherently corrupt and utterly incapable of
								choosing or doing that which is acceptable to God apart from
								divine grace. With no recuperative powers to enable him to
								recover himself, man is hopelessly lost. Man’s salvation is
								thereby wholly of God’s grace through the redemptive work of our
								Lord Jesus Christ (Genesis 2:16-17; 3:1-19; John 3:36; Romans
								3:23, 6:23; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Ephesians 2:1-3; 1 Timothy
								2:13-14; 1 John 1:8).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								4. Universal Sinfulness
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that because all men were in Adam, the consequence of
								Adam’s sin has been transmitted (imputed) to all men of all
								ages, Jesus Christ being the only exception. All men are thus
								sinners by divine declaration, by nature, and by choice (Psalm
								14:1-3; Jeremiah 17:9; Romans 3:9-18, 23; 5:10-12).

						IV. Salvation
					</h2>

					<div className="space-y-4">
						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								1. General Overview
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that salvation is wholly of God by grace, through the
								redemption of Jesus Christ, the merit of His shed blood, and not
								on the basis of human merit or works (John 1:12; Ephesians 1:7;
								2:8-10; 1 Peter 1:18-19).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								A. Regeneration
							</h3>
							<p>
								1. We teach that regeneration is a supernatural work of the Holy
								Spirit by which the divine nature and divine life are given
								(John 3:3-7).
							</p>
							<p>
								2. We teach that regeneration is instantaneous and is
								accomplished solely by the power of the Holy Spirit through the
								instrumentality of the Word of God (John 5:24).
							</p>
							<p>
								3. We teach that the Holy Spirit enables voluntary obedience to
								the gospel.
							</p>
							<p>
								4. We teach that genuine regeneration is manifested by
								repentance, faith, and righteous living. Good works will be its
								proper evidence and fruit (1 Corinthians 6:19-20; Ephesians
								2:10), and will manifest to the extent that the believer submits
								to the control of the Holy Spirit in his life through faithful
								obedience to the Word of God (Ephesians 5:17-21; Philippians
								2:12b; Colossians 3:16; 2 Peter 1:4-10). This obedience causes
								the believer to be increasingly conformed to the image of our
								Lord Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 3:18). Such a conformity is
								climaxed in the believer’s glorification at Christ’s coming
								(Romans 8:17; 2 Peter 1:4; 1 John 3:2-3).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								B. Election
							</h3>
							<p>
								1. We teach that election is the act of God by which, before the
								foundation of the world, He chose in Christ those whom He
								graciously regenerates, saves, and sanctifies (Romans 8:28-30;
								Ephesians 1:4-11; 2 Thessalonians 2:13; 2 Timothy 2:10; 1 Peter
								1:1-2).
							</p>
							<p>
								2. We teach that sovereign election does not contradict or
								negate the responsibility of man to repent and trust Christ as
								Savior and Lord (Ezekiel 18:23, 32; 33:11; John 3:18-19, 36;
								5:40; Romans 9:22-23; 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12; Revelation
								22:17). Nevertheless, since sovereign grace includes the means
								of receiving the gift of salvation as well as the gift itself,
								sovereign election will result in what God determines. All whom
								the Father calls to Himself will come in faith, and all who come
								in faith the Father will receive (John 6:37-40, 44; Acts 13:48;
								James 4:8).
							</p>
							<p>
								3. We teach that the unmerited favor that God grants to totally
								depraved sinners is not related to any initiative on their own
								part nor to God’s anticipation of what they might do by their
								own will, but is solely of His sovereign grace and mercy
								(Ephesians 1:4-7; Titus 3:4-7; 1 Peter 1:2).
							</p>
							<p>
								4. We teach that election should not be looked upon as based
								merely on abstract sovereignty. God is truly sovereign, but He
								exercises this sovereignty in harmony with His other attributes,
								especially His omniscience, justice, holiness, and wisdom
								(Romans 9:11-16). This sovereignty will always exalt the will of
								God in a manner totally consistent with His character as
								revealed in the life of our Lord Jesus Christ (Matthew 11:25-28;
								2 Timothy 1:9).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								C. Justification
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that justification before God is an act of God (Romans
								8:33), by which He declares righteous those who through faith in
								Christ repent of their sins (Luke 13:3; Acts 2:38; 3:19; 11:18;
								Romans 2:4; 2 Corinthians 7:10; Isaiah 55:6-7) and confess Him
								as sovereign Lord (Romans 10:9-10; 1 Corinthians 12:3; 2
								Corinthians 4:5; Philippians 2:11). This righteousness is apart
								from any virtue or work of man (Romans 3:20; 4:6) and involves
								the imputation of our sins to Christ (Colossians 2:14; 1 Peter
								2:24) and the imputation of Christ’s righteousness to us (1
								Corinthians 1:30; 2 Corinthians 5:21). By this means God is
								enabled to “be just, and the justifier of the one who has faith
								in Jesus” (Romans 3:26).

								D. Sanctification
							</h3>
							<p>
								1. We teach that every believer is sanctified (set apart) unto
								God by the death of our Lord Jesus Christ, is therefore declared
								to be holy, and is therefore identified as a saint. This is
								positional and instantaneous and should not be confused with
								progressive sanctification. This sanctification has to do with
								the believer’s standing, not his present walk or condition (Acts
								20:32; 1 Corinthians 1:2, 30; 6:11; 2 Thessalonians 2:13;
								Hebrews 2:11; 3:1; 10:10, 14; 13:12; 1 Peter 1:2).
							</p>
							<p>
								2. We teach that there is also, by the work of the Holy Spirit,
								a progressive sanctification by which the state of the believer
								is brought closer to the standing the believer positionally
								enjoys through justification. Through obedience to the Word of
								God and the empowering of the Holy Spirit, the believer is able
								to live a life of increasing holiness in conformity to the will
								of God, becoming more and more like our Lord Jesus Christ (John
								17:17, 19; Romans 6:1-22; 2 Corinthians 3:18; 1 Thessalonians
								4:3-4; 5:23).
							</p>
							<p>
								3. We teach that every saved person is involved in a daily
								conflict–the new creation in Christ doing battle against the
								flesh–but adequate provision is made for victory through the
								power of the indwelling Holy Spirit. The struggle nevertheless
								stays with the believer all through this earthly life and is
								never completely ended. All claims to the eradication of sin in
								this life are unscriptural. Eradication of sin is not possible,
								but the Holy Spirit does provide for victory over sin (Galatians
								5:16-25; Ephesians 4:22-24; Philippians 3:12; Colossians 3:9-10;
								1 Peter 1:14-16; 1 John 3:5-9).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								E. Security
							</h3>
							<p>
								1. We teach that all the redeemed, once saved, are kept by God’s
								power and are thus secure in Christ forever (John 5:24; 6:37-40;
								10:27-30; Romans 5:9-10; 8:1, 31-39; 1 Corinthians 1:4-8;
								Ephesians 4:30; Hebrews 7:25; 13:5; 1 Peter 1:5; Jude 24).
							</p>
							<p>
								2. We teach that it is the privilege of believers to rejoice in
								the assurance of their salvation through the testimony of God’s
								Word, which, however, clearly forbids the use of Christian
								liberty as an occasion for sinful living and carnality (Romans
								6:15-22; 13:13-14; Galatians 5:13, 25-26; Titus 2:11-14).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								F. Separation from Sin
							</h3>
							<p>
								1. We teach that separation from sin is clearly called for
								throughout the Old and New Testaments, and that the Scriptures
								clearly indicate that in the last days apostasy and worldliness
								shall increase (2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1; 2 Timothy 3:1-5).
							</p>
							<p>
								2. We teach that out of deep gratitude for the undeserved grace
								of God granted to us and because our glorious God is so worthy
								of our total consecration, all the saved should live in such a
								manner as to demonstrate our adoring love to God and so as not
								to bring reproach upon our Savior and Lord. We also teach that
								separation from all religious apostasy, and worldly and sinful
								practices is commanded of us by God (Romans 12:1-2; 1
								Corinthians 5:9-13; 2 Corinthians 6:14-7:1; 1 John 2:15-17; 2
								John 9-11).
							</p>
							<p>
								3. We teach that believers should be separated unto our Lord
								Jesus Christ (2 Thessalonians 1:11-12; Hebrews 12:1-2) and
								affirm that the Christian life is a life of obedient
								righteousness demonstrated by a beatitude attitude (Matthew
								5:2-12) and a continual pursuit of holiness (Romans 12:1-2; 2
								Corinthians 7:1; Hebrews 12:14; Titus 2:11-14; 1 John 3:1-10).

						V. The Church
					</h2>

					<div className="space-y-4">
						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								1. General Overview
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that all who place their faith in Jesus Christ are
								immediately baptized by the Holy Spirit into one united
								spiritual body, the church (1 Corinthians 12:12-13), the bride
								of Christ (2 Corinthians 11:2; Ephesians 5:23-32; Revelation
								19:7-8), of which Christ is the head (Ephesians 1:22; 4:15;
								Colossians 1:18).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that the formation of the church, the body of Christ,
								began on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:1-21, 38-47) and will be
								completed at the coming of Christ for His own at the rapture (1
								Corinthians 15:51-52; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that the church is thus a unique spiritual organism
								designed by Christ, made up of all born again believers in this
								present age (Ephesians 2:11-3:6). The church is distinct from
								Israel (1 Corinthians 10:32), a mystery not revealed until this
								age (Ephesians 3:1-6; 5:32).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that the establishment and continuity of local churches
								is clearly taught and defined in the New Testament Scriptures
								(Acts 14:23,27; 20:17,28; Galatians 1:2; Philippians 1:1; 1
								Thessalonians 1:1; 2 Thessalonians 1:1) and that the members of
								this one spiritual body are directed to associate themselves
								together in local assemblies (1 Corinthians 11:18-20; Hebrews
								10:25).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								A. The Church: Leaders
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that the one supreme authority for the church is Christ
								(1 Corinthians 11:3; Ephesians 1:22; Colossians 1:18) and that
								church leadership, gifts, order, discipline, and worship are all
								appointed through His sovereignty as found in the Scriptures.
								The biblically designated officers serving under Christ and over
								the assembly are elders (also called bishops, pastors and
								pastor-teachers– Acts 20:28; Ephesians 4:11), and deacons, both
								of whom must meet biblical qualifications (1 Timothy 3:1-13;
								Titus 1:5-9; 1 Peter 5:1-5).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that these leaders lead or rule as servants of Christ
								(1 Timothy 5:17-22) and have His authority in directing the
								church. The congregation is to submit to their leadership
								(Hebrews 13:7,17).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach the importance of discipleship (Matthew 28:19-20; 2
								Timothy 2:2), mutual accountability of all believers to each
								other (Matthew 18:5-14), as well as the need for discipline of
								sinning members of the congregation in accord with the standards
								of Scripture (Matthew 18:15-22; Acts 5:1-11; 1 Corinthians
								5:1-13; 2 Thessalonians 3:6-15; 1 Timothy 1:19-20; Titus
								1:10-16).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								B. The Church: Autonomy
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach the autonomy of the local church, free from any
								external authority or control, with the right of self-government
								and freedom from the interference of any hierarchy of
								individuals or organizations (Titus 1:5). We teach that it is
								scriptural for true churches to cooperate with each other for
								the presentation and propagation of the faith. Each local
								church, however, through its elders and their interpretation and
								application of Scripture, should be the sole judge of the
								measure and method of its cooperation. The elders should
								determine all other matters of membership, policy, discipline,
								benevolence, and government as well (Acts 15:19-31; 20:28; 1
								Corinthians 5:4-7,13; 1 Peter 5:1-4).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that the purpose of the church is to glorify God
								(Ephesians 3:21) by building itself up in the faith (Ephesians
								4:13-16), by instruction of the Word (2 Timothy 2:2,15;
								3:16-17), by fellowship (Acts 2:47; 1 John 1:3), by keeping the
								ordinances (Luke 22:19; Acts 2:38-42) and by advancing and
								communicating the gospel to the entire world (Matthew 28:19;
								Acts 1:8; 2:42).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								C. The Church: Equipping
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach the calling of all saints to the work of the ministry
								(1 Corinthians 15:58; Ephesians 4:12; Revelation 22:12). We
								teach the need of the church to cooperate with God as He
								accomplishes His purpose in the world. To that end, He gives the
								church spiritual gifts. First, He gives men chosen for the
								purpose of equipping the saints for the work of the ministry
								(Ephesians 4:7-12) and He also gives unique and special
								spiritual abilities to each member of the body of Christ (Romans
								12:5-8; 1 Corinthians 12:4-31; 1 Peter 4:10-11). At the moment
								of spiritual birth every believer receives such a gift or gifts
								(1 Corinthians 12:4-13). These gifts are sovereignly bestowed
								and cannot be sought (1 Corinthians 12:11). It is essential that
								every believer discovers, develops, and employs his spiritual
								gift or gifts for the edification of the body and the
								accomplishment of the work of Christ in the world (Romans
								12:3-8; 1 Peter 4:10-11).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								D. The Church: Signs and Wonders
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that there were two kinds of gifts given the early
								church: miraculous gifts of divine revelation and healing, given
								temporarily in the apostolic era for the purpose of confirming
								the authenticity of the Apostles’ message (Hebrews 2:3-4); and
								ministering gifts, given to equip believers for edifying one
								another. With the New Testament revelation now complete,
								Scripture becomes the sole test of the authenticity of a man’s
								message, and confirming gifts of a miraculous nature are no
								longer necessary to validate a man or his message (1 Corinthians
								13:8-12). Miraculous gifts can even be counterfeited by Satan so
								as to deceive even believers (1 Corinthians 13:13–14:12;
								Revelation 13:13-14). The only gifts in operation today are
								those non-revelatory equipping gifts given for edification
								(Romans 12:6-8).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that the confirming gifts of the apostolic period–
								healing, speaking in tongues (unlearned foreign languages),
								interpretation, and the working of miracles– gradually ceased as
								the New Testament Scriptures were completed and their authority
								became established (compare 1 Corinthians 13:8-10; 2 Corinthians
								12:12; Hebrews 2:3-4; Acts 19:11-12 with 1 Corinthians 12:1-31)
								until the eternal state (1 Corinthians 13:8-12).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that no one possesses the gift of healing today but
								that God does hear and answer the prayer of faith on the part of
								every believer and will answer in accordance with His own
								perfect will for the sick, suffering, and afflicted (Luke
								18:1-6; John 5:7-9; 2 Corinthians 12:6-10; James 5:13-16; 1 John
								5:14-15).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								E. The Church: Ordinances
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that two ordinances have been committed to the local
								church: baptism and the Lord’s Supper (Acts 2:38-42). Christian
								baptism by water preferably by immersion (Acts 8:36-39) is the
								solemn and beautiful testimony of a believer showing forth his
								faith in the crucified, buried, and risen Savior, and his union
								with Him in death to sin and resurrection to a new life (Romans
								6:1-11). It is also a sign of fellowship and identification with
								the visible body of Christ (Acts 2:41-42).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that the Lord’s Supper is the commemoration and
								proclamation of His death until He comes, and should be always
								preceded by solemn self-examination (1 Corinthians 11:28-32). We
								also teach that whereas the elements of communion are only
								representative of the flesh and blood of Christ, the Lord’s
								Supper is nevertheless an actual communion with the risen
								Christ, who is present in a unique way, fellowshipping with His
								people (1 Corinthians 10:16).

						VI. The Spiritual Realm
					</h2>

					<div className="space-y-4">
						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								A. Angels
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that angels are created beings and are therefore not to
								be worshipped. Although they are a higher order of creation than
								man, they are created to serve God and to worship Him (Luke
								2:9-14; Hebrews 1:6-7,14; 2:6-7; Revelation 5:11-14; 19:10;
								22:9).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that Satan is a created angel and the author of sin. He
								incurred the judgment of God by rebelling against his Creator,
								by taking numerous angels with Him in his fall (Job 1:6-7;
								Isaiah 14:12-17; Ezekiel 28:11-19), and by introducing sin into
								the human race by his temptation of Eve (Genesis 3:1-15). We
								teach that Satan is the open and declared enemy of God and man
								(Isaiah 14:13-14; Matthew 4:1-11; Revelation 12:9-10), the
								prince of this world who has been defeated through the death and
								resurrection of Jesus Christ (Romans 16:20) and that he shall be
								eternally punished in the lake of fire (Isaiah 14:12-17; Ezekiel
								28:11-19; Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">B. Death</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that physical death involves no loss of our immaterial
								consciousness (Revelation 6:9-11), that the soul of the redeemed
								passes immediately into the presence of Christ (Luke 23:43;
								Philippians 1:23; 2 Corinthians 5:8), that there is a separation
								of soul and body (Philippians 1:21-24) and that such separation
								will continue until the first resurrection (Revelation 20:4-6),
								when our spirit, soul, and body will be reunited to be glorified
								forever with our Lord (Philippians 3:21; 1 Corinthians 15:35-44,
								50-54; 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17). Until that time, the souls of
								the redeemed in Christ remain in joyful fellowship with our Lord
								Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 5:8).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach the bodily resurrection of all men, the saved to
								eternal life (John 6:39; Romans 8:10-11, 19-23; 2 Corinthians
								4:14) and the unsaved to judgment and everlasting punishment
								(Daniel 12:2; John 5:29; Revelation 20:13-15).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that the souls of the unsaved at death are kept under
								punishment in hell until the second resurrection (Luke 16:19-26;
								Revelation 20:13-15), when the soul and a resurrection body will
								be united (John 5:28-29). They shall then appear at the Great
								White Throne judgment (Revelation 20:11-15) and shall be cast
								into the lake of fire (Matthew 25:41-46), cut off from the life
								of God forever (Daniel 12:2; Matthew 25:41-46; 2 Thessalonians
								1:7-9).
							</p>

						VII. Future Things in Scripture
					</h2>

					<div className="space-y-4">
						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								A. The Rapture of the Church
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach the personal, bodily return of our Lord Jesus Christ (1
								Thessalonians 4:16; Titus 2:13) to translate His church from
								this earth (John 14:1-3; 1 Corinthians 15:51-53; 1 Thessalonians
								4:15-5:11) and to reward believers according to their works (1
								Corinthians 3:11-15; 2 Corinthians 5:10) with sufficient time
								elapsing between this event and His glorious return with His
								church to allow for the judgment of believers’ works.
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								B. The Tribulation Period
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that immediately following the removal of the church
								from the earth (John 14:1-3; 1 Thessalonians 4:13-18) the
								righteous judgments of God will be poured out upon an
								unbelieving world (Jeremiah 30:7; Daniel 9:27; 12:1; 2
								Thessalonians 2:7-12; Revelation 16), and that these judgments
								will be climaxed by the return of Christ in glory to the earth
								(Matthew 24:27-31; 25:31-46; 2 Thessalonians 2:7-12). At that
								time the Old Testament and tribulation saints will be raised and
								the living will be judged (Daniel 12:2-3; Revelation 20:4-6).
								This period includes the seventieth week of Daniel’s prophecy
								(Daniel 9:24-27; Matthew 24:15-31; 25:31-46).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								C. The Second Coming of Christ & His Millennial Reign
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that after the tribulation period, Christ will come to
								earth to occupy the throne of David (Matthew 25:31; Luke
								1:31-33; Acts 1:10-11; 2:29-30) and establish His Messianic
								kingdom for a thousand years on the earth (Revelation 20:1-7).
								During this time the resurrected saints will reign with Him over
								Israel and all the nations of the earth (Ezekiel 37:21-28;
								Daniel 7:17-22; Revelation 19:11-16). This reign will be
								preceded by the overthrow of the antichrist and the false
								prophet, and the removal of Satan from the world (Daniel
								7:17-27; Revelation 20:1-7).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that the kingdom itself will be the fulfillment of
								God’s promise to Israel (Isaiah 65:17-25; Ezekiel 37:21-28;
								Zechariah 8:1-17) to restore them to the land which they
								forfeited through their disobedience (Deuteronomy 28:15-68). The
								result of their disobedience was that Israel was temporarily set
								aside (Matthew 21:43; Romans 11:1-26) but will again be awakened
								through repentance to enter into the land of blessing (Jeremiah
								31:31-34; Ezekiel 36:22-32; Romans 11:25-29).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that this time of our Lord’s reign will be
								characterized by harmony, justice, peace, righteousness, and
								long life (Isaiah 11; 65:17-25; Ezekiel 36:33-38), and will be
								brought to an end with the release of Satan (Revelation 20:7).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								D. The Judgment of the Lost and Hell
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that following the release of Satan after the thousand
								year reign of Christ (Revelation 20:7), Satan will deceive the
								nations of the earth and gather them to battle against the
								saints and the beloved city. At that time Satan and his army
								will be devoured by fire from heaven (Revelation 20:9).
								Following this, Satan will be thrown into the lake of fire and
								brimstone (Matthew 25:41; Revelation 20:10) whereupon Christ,
								who is the judge of all men (John 5:22), will resurrect and
								judge the great and small at the Great White Throne judgment
								(Revelation 20:11-13).
							</p>
							<p>
								We teach that this resurrection of the unsaved dead to judgment
								will be a physical resurrection, whereupon receiving their
								judgment (Romans 14:10-13), they will be committed to an eternal
								conscious punishment in the lake of fire (Matthew 25:41;
								Revelation 20:14-15).
							</p>
						</div>

						<div>
							<h3 className="text-lg font-semibold text-navy mb-2">
								E. Eternity
							</h3>
							<p>
								We teach that after the closing of the millennium, the temporary
								release of Satan, and the judgment of unbelievers (2
								Thessalonians 1:9; Revelation 20:7-15), the saved will enter the
								eternal state of glory with God, after which the elements of
								this earth are to be dissolved (2 Peter 3:10) and replaced with
								a new earth wherein only righteousness dwells (Ephesians 5:5;
								Revelation 20:15; 21-22). Following this, the heavenly city will
								come down out of heaven (Revelation 21:2) and will be the
								dwelling place of the saints, where they will enjoy forever
								fellowship with God and one another (John 17:3; Revelation
								21,22). Our Lord Jesus Christ, having fulfilled His redemptive
								mission, will then deliver up the kingdom to God the Father (1
								Corinthians 15:24-28) that in all spheres the triune God may
								reign forever and ever (1 Corinthians 15:28).
